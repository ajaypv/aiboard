"""# Gemini - Multimodal live API: Tool use

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_LiveAPI_tools.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" height=30/></a>

This notebook provides examples of how to use tools with the multimodal live API with [Gemini 2.5](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-v2).

The API provides Google Search, Code Execution and Function Calling tools. The earlier Gemini models supported versions of these tools. The biggest change with Gemini 2.5 (in the Live API) is that, basically, all the tools are handled by Code Execution. With that change, you can use **multiple tools** in a single API call, and the model can use multiple tools in a single code execution block.  

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the Live API, as described in the [this tutorial](../quickstarts/Get_started_LiveAPI.ipynb).

## Setup

### Install SDK

The new **[Google Gen AI SDK](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/sdks)** provides programmatic access to Gemini 2.5 (and previous models) using both the [Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/overview) APIs. With a few exceptions, code that runs on one platform will run on both. This means that you can prototype an application using the Developer API and then migrate the application to Vertex AI without rewriting your code.

More details about this new SDK on the [documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/sdks) or in the [Getting started](../quickstarts/Get_started.ipynb) notebook.

"""### Setup your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/colab_icon16.png)](../quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.

Either select the latest stable model or one of the preview ones. Note that the native audio models like `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025` won't work in this notebook as they only can't output text only which is what colab imposes to us.

"""## Get started

Most of the Live API setup will be similar to the [starter tutorial](../quickstarts/Get_started_LiveAPI.ipynb). Since this tutorial doesn't focus on the realtime interactivity of the API, the code has been simplified: This code uses the Live API, but it only sends a single text prompt, and listens for a single turn of replies.

You can set `modality="AUDIO"` on any of the examples to get the spoken version of the output.

"""## Next Steps

- For more information about the SDK see the [SDK docs](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/)
- This tutorial uses the high level SDK, if you're interested in the lower-level details, try the [Websocket version of this tutorial](../quickstarts/websockets/Get_started_LiveAPI_tools.ipynb)
- This tutorial only covers _basic_ usage of these tools for deeper (and more fun) example see the [Search tool tutorial](./Search_Grounding.ipynb)

Or check the other Gemini 2.5 capabilities from the [Cookbook](../gemini-2/), in particular this other [multi-tool](../examples/LiveAPI_plotting_and_mapping.ipynb) example and the one about Gemini [spatial capabilities](../quickstarts/Spatial_understanding.ipynb).
